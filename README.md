# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM-and-ARIMA
This was my first ML/DL project.

In this project, I explored the historical price data 
of the AAPL, GOOG, AMZN and FB stocks and tired to predict
the price and the trend of the GOOG stock using LSTM and ARIMA models.

The LSTM model did not work that well in terms of predicting the pricepoint,
but its performance in predicting the trend was rather acceptable.
I decided to use the ARIMA model to regressively predict the pricepoint without
worrying that much about the trend itself.
